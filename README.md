# Straddle CLI

**Every Straddle API operation, plus a local payments ledger, offline search, and settlement and return analytics no stateless tool can do.**

A full CLI for Straddle's Pay by Bank and Embed APIs that also keeps a local SQLite copy of your charges, payouts, customers, paykeys, and funding events. On top of the synced store it adds reconciliation, a cancel-window payment pipeline, return analysis, and cashflow analytics that the official stateless CLI cannot offer.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install straddle-build/tap/straddle
```

> Available with the next patch release — the tap's publish credential is being provisioned. Use the shell installer below meanwhile.

### Shell installer (macOS / Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/straddle-build/cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the latest release to `~/.local/bin` (override with `STRADDLE_INSTALL_DIR`) after verifying its checksum against the release's `checksums.txt`.

### npm / npx

```bash
npx @straddleio/cli doctor   # run without installing
npm i -g @straddleio/cli     # install the straddle binary globally
```

> Publishing with the next patch release — the npm token is being provisioned. Use the shell installer above meanwhile.

### Pre-built binaries

Download an archive for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/straddle-build/cli/releases). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/straddle-build/cli/cmd/straddle@latest
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/straddle-build/cli && cd cli && make build   # -> bin/straddle
```

### Agent skill

The repo-root [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) teaches coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and friends) how to drive this CLI. Install it with the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI:

```bash
npx skills add straddle-build/cli
```

## Authentication

Straddle uses a Bearer JWT API key. Set `STRADDLE_API_KEY` or save one with `straddle auth set-token`; set `STRADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox|production` when you need a non-default environment. Sandbox keys only work against `sandbox.straddle.com` and production keys only work against `production.straddle.com`. The default environment is sandbox so you never hit live money movement by accident. Platform (Embed) integrators declare an integration type with `straddle setup` and scope account-specific calls with `straddle use-account` or `--account`: a SaaS platform scopes customer, paykey, bridge, payment, review, and funding-event calls; a marketplace scopes payment and funding-event calls but does not scope customer or paykey calls; a direct account never sets the header. Account-management and onboarding calls carry account IDs in the path or body, not in `Straddle-Account-Id`. Platform ID, Organization ID, and Account ID are three different identifiers, do not interchange them.

Get your API key from the [Straddle dashboard](https://dashboard.straddle.com) (Developer → API Keys); see the [authentication docs](https://docs.straddle.com/api-reference/authentication) for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Confirm STRADDLE_API_KEY is set and the chosen environment is reachable before anything else.
straddle doctor


# Pull charges, payouts, customers, paykeys, and funding events into the local store so search and analytics work offline.
straddle sync


# Search across charges and payouts in one call; the unified payments view is the fastest way to see recent activity.
straddle payments --json


# See which synced payments have not yet settled to a funding event.
straddle reconcile --outstanding --json


# Find payments you can still cancel before they reach the locked pending state.
straddle pipeline --cancelable --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Settlement & cashflow
- **`reconcile`** — Match synced charges and payouts to their funding events locally, showing what has settled to your account and what is still outstanding.

  _Reach for this to answer 'which charges funded this deposit' or 'what is still unsettled' without paging the API per payment._

  ```bash
  straddle reconcile --outstanding --json
  ```
- **`cashflow`** — Aggregate synced charge volume in versus payout volume out over a date window, including zero-activity days, with net flow per day or week.

  _Use to see money in versus money out at a glance, including the days nothing moved, without summing payments by hand._

  ```bash
  straddle cashflow --days 30 --json
  ```

### Payment lifecycle control
- **`pipeline`** — Group synced charges and payouts by lifecycle status and flag which are still cancelable (created/scheduled/on_hold) versus locked once they reach pending.

  _Use before a cutoff to find every payment you can still stop, since pending and later states cannot be cancelled._

  ```bash
  straddle pipeline --cancelable --json
  ```
- **`returns`** — Surface failed and reversed payments with their ACH reason codes and rank repeat-offender paykeys and customers from the local store.

  _Use to spot accounts that keep returning (R01 NSF, R02 closed, R05 dispute) so you can block or re-verify them._

  ```bash
  straddle returns --days 30 --repeat-offenders --json
  ```

### Risk & identity ops
- **`review-queue`** — List customers and paykeys sitting in review status, oldest first, with age-in-queue so the KYC backlog is triageable.

  _Use to clear the identity backlog: these are the items blocking downstream charges and payouts from releasing._

  ```bash
  straddle review-queue --json
  ```
- **`expiring`** — List paykeys approaching their expires_at and blocked paykeys that are unblock-eligible, so payments do not fail on stale tokens.

  _Use to find paykeys to refresh or unblock before recurring charges fail against an expired or blocked token._

  ```bash
  straddle expiring --days 14 --json
  ```

### Sandbox testing
- **`sandbox`** — Print the deterministic sandbox_outcome values for customers, paykeys, charges, and payouts plus the sandbox test bank values so test scenarios are scriptable.

  _Use when writing sandbox tests to pick the exact sandbox_outcome (paid, failed_insufficient_funds, reversed_customer_dispute) that triggers the state you want._

  ```bash
  straddle sandbox outcomes --json
  ```

### Full API coverage
- **`api`** - Browse hidden API interfaces or call a raw API path with the same auth, account scoping, dry-run, verify, output, and redaction behavior as the friendly commands.

  _Use this when a newly published endpoint exists in the API before a dedicated top-level command has been tuned._

  ```bash
  straddle api
  straddle api get /v1/charges --param limit=10 --json
  echo '{}' | straddle api post /v1/charges --stdin --agent
  ```

- **`straddle reports`** - Create

### representatives

Representatives are individuals who have legal authority or significant responsibility within a business entity associated with a Straddle account. Each representative undergoes automated verification as part of KYC/KYB compliance. Use representatives to collect and verify beneficial owners, control persons, and authorized signers required for account onboarding. Representatives also determine who can legally operate the account and make important changes.

- **`straddle representatives create`** - Creates a new representative associated with an account. Representatives are individuals who have legal authority or significant responsibility within the business.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
straddle accounts list

# JSON for scripting and agents
straddle accounts list --json

# Filter to specific fields
straddle accounts list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
straddle accounts list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
straddle accounts list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Runtime Endpoint

This CLI resolves endpoint placeholders at runtime, so one installed binary can target different tenants or API versions without rebuilding.

Endpoint environment variables:
- `STRADDLE_ENVIRONMENT` resolves `{environment}` and defaults to `sandbox` when unset

Base URL: `https://{environment}.straddle.com`

## Health Check

```bash
straddle doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/straddle/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `STRADDLE_ENVIRONMENT` | endpoint | No | Resolves `{environment}` in the base URL; defaults to `sandbox`. |
| `STRADDLE_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `straddle doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $STRADDLE_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized on every call** — Set STRADDLE_API_KEY to a key for the environment you target; sandbox keys do not work against production and vice versa.
- **Calls hit the wrong environment** - Set `STRADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` or `STRADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=production` (default is sandbox); the base URL switches between sandbox.straddle.com and production.straddle.com.
- **A charge cannot be cancelled or held** — Once a payment reaches pending it is locked; run pipeline --cancelable to see which payments are still in created/scheduled/on_hold and can be acted on.
- **Charges fail with an expired paykey** — Run expiring to list paykeys near expires_at, then refresh or re-bridge the bank account before retrying.
- **search or reconcile returns nothing** — Run sync first; the local store is empty until you populate it.
- **Platform calls return the wrong account's data or 403** - Run `straddle setup --type saas|marketplace`, set the acting account with `straddle use-account acct_...`, or pass `--account acct_...` for one command. SaaS platforms scope customer, paykey, bridge, payment, review, and funding-event calls; marketplaces scope payment and funding-event calls; direct accounts omit it.
