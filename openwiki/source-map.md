## Command groups worth knowing

### API command families

These command families mirror Straddle API resources. In general:
- `list` retrieves collections
- `get` retrieves one object by id
- `create` sends a new object to Straddle
- `update` modifies an existing object before it is finalized

## How to use this map

If you need to change a command, start with the command's file under `internal/cli/`, then follow its helpers into `internal/store/`, `internal/client/`, or `internal/straddleacct/` as needed.

If you need a fast orientation for a future edit, this page should tell you which file family to inspect first.
